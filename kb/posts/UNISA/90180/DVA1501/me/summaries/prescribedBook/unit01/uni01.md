# Introduction

<u>Poorer countries</u> are often referred to as the following by governments or international organizations:

- North / South
- Third World / First World

<details>
           <summary>Context</summary>
           <p>In order to understand the position of poorer countries in the world, we must acknowledge that they have long histories of exploitation through colonialism.</p>
</details>

Also look at how the following international institutions refer to groups of countries <u>based on their wealth and/or human development</u>:

- World Bank
- International Monetary Fund (IMF)
- United Nations (UN) organizations
- The media

<u>They distinguish between</u>:

- the most developed countries
- developed countries
- less developed countries
- developing countries
- least developed countries

The World Bank and the IMF use economic indicators such as:

- GDP per capita
- GNP per capita
- GNI per capita.

The UN uses both the following to measure development in a country:

- economic indicators
- and human development indicators

# Defining Development

Development means different things to different people, especially professionals.\
<u>Such as</u>:

- For an **economist**, development means a high economic growth rate in a country.
- For a **rural extension officer**, development means an increase in a small farmer’s agricultural productivity.
- For a **community development agent**, development means fostering resilient communities and seeing that their basic needs are met.

> Development was at first seen mainly as economic development but as it became apparent that poverty had not lessened with economic development, new theories emerged that were more people centred

> According to Oxford learner’s dictionaries, the term “development” means “the steady growth of something so that it becomes more advanced [and] stronger”.

<u>The internationally accepted definition of development is</u>:

> “a multidimensional undertaking to achieve a higher quality of life for all people”
>
> > United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) (2021a)

Development studies as an area of study therefore focuses on human development.\
<u>In the Human development report (UNDP 2021b), human development is defined as:</u>

> “the process of enlarging people’s freedoms and opportunities and improving their well-being. Human development is about the real freedom ordinary people have to decide who to be, what to do, and how to live”.
>
> > Mahbub ul Haq (Internationally accepted definition of human development)

**Development studies is a bit more selective in its focus on human development**.\

<details>
           <summary>Context</summary>
           <p>The reality is that out of the world population of 7,9 billion people, 689 million people live in extreme or absolute poverty on less than $1,90 a day.</p>
           <p>The number of extremely poor people stabilized in 2018 but the Covid-19 pandemic pushed an additional 150 million people into extreme poverty by 2021 (World Bank 2021b).</p>
           <p>This means that almost 9,2% of the world’s population live in a state of severe deprivation in that they cannot fulfil their basic needs for food, water, shelter and clothing (World Bank 2021b).</p>
</details>

<u>Development studies is:</u>\
Mainly focused on understanding the **plight of the absolute poor in rural and urban areas of the developing world and the factors that impede their development**.

<details>
           <summary>Context</summary>
           <p>Please note, that a staggering 433 million or 63% of the global absolute poor live in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
           <p>It is also expected that this number will rise owing to the economic backlash of the Covid-19 pandemic (World Bank 2021b).</p>
</details>

The following Box 1.1 contains an extract from Kingsbury et al (2004:2) that gives insight into the meaning of development

> The idea of ‘development’ of the world’s poorer countries is both highly contentious and
> central to international relations. Put simply, the study of development is concerned with
> how ‘developing countries’ can improve their living standards and eliminate absolute po-
> verty. Development has a range of meanings, which while in most cases complementary or
> at least overlapping, may be quite distinct in the priority they give, for example, to equity, to
> political development and democratization, to gender, or to environmental issues and thus
> in their implications for action. Even the terminology of development has changed and is
> continuing to change. The whole approach to development, assumed for years to occur
> through a process of industrialization, is also now in question. The emphasis on develop-
> ment has increasingly moved away from what the ‘experts’ say ‘development’ is, to what
> people seeking ‘development’ want it to be.
> . The shift in the categorization of what constitutes development began to not only diversify
> ‘ownership’ of the meaning of development, but also reflected the diversity of responses to
> the development process. Development is, perhaps the world’s most critical problem, incor-
> porating most of the world’s pressing issues. At the same time, the subject of development
> has retreated to increasingly simple formulae in the minds of many of the people and gov-
> ernments able to address it meaningfully. For the purpose of the book, and as already
> indicated, development means the process by which the people and states outside the indus-
> trialized world attempt to improve their conditions of life, through material and social
> means. In this development implies change, affecting most, if not all, areas of life. The idea
> of development is a multi-dimensional and, by definition, interdisciplinary field in which
> economic, political, technological, social and cultural factors interact.

# The Colonial History Of Africa

<u>Up until the 16th century</u>\
trade occurred mainly between the countries of:

- the Mediterranean,
- China and India.

Following the invention of the compass, Europeans could reach the Americas.\
European countries such as England, France, Spain, Portugal and The Netherlands became very wealthy\
East Asia

- tobacco, tea and opium

Americas

- gold and silver

Africa

- gold, ivory and slaves

> > (Prabhakar 2003:310–312; Linden 2003:52)

The European countries began to compete with each other in order to safeguard their trade interests in their overseas markets.\
In the process they found it beneficial to exercise dominance and control over their trade areas.\
This is called imperialism.

During the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries this informal economic and political domination became more aggressive,\
to the point that military force was used to establish complete military and political control and dominion over these areas.\
The European countries also settled these countries with their own people.\
They claimed absolute sovereignty over these regions and established government systems, legal and social structures, and economic systems in these territories.\
This is called colonization.

The colonies became an extension of the European countries’ own territories.\
Latin America and Asia were the first continents to become colonized.\
Most of Latin America belonged to Spain and Portugal by the beginning of the 1800s.\
Territories in Asia were first under the influence of Spain and Portugal but were taken over by The Netherlands, England and France in the 17th century.\
Britain was the most successful colonizer in Asia and most of Asia belonged to Britain at the end of the Second World War.

The colonization of territories brought great wealth to the colonizers.\
The chief objective of the colonizers was to exploit the colonies’ natural resources and labour to fuel their home-based industries and development.\
Consequently, the infrastructure and the systems that were put in place in the colonies were there for the sole purpose of extracting resources and raw materials.\
These raw materials included minerals and precious stones, food and cash crops, wood and many other products. (Linden 2003:52).

The period of colonization lasted until after the Second World War in 1945 (Prabhakar 2003:313– 314).\
Spain and Portugal lost control over their Latin American territories by 1830.\
Africa was the last continent to be colonized.\
The only European countries that had influence in Africa before 1860 were Britain, France and Portugal.\
Before 1860, they exercised their influence mainly over the coastal areas of Africa.\
The reason why Africa was colonized last was that the Europeans found the conditions in Africa dangerous.\
Many Europeans, for instance, died from diseases such as malaria (Oliver 2005:118– 129).\
In 1820 it was discovered that quinine can treat malaria very effectively.\
As a result, Europeans started to venture deeper into Africa.\
Expeditions led by explorers such as David Livingstone and Henry Morton Stanley in the mid-1800s provided useful information about the interior of Africa.\
At the same time, one of the consequences of industrialization in Europe was the negative effect of industrial capitalism on the European populace.\
Not all labour could be absorbed by European industries.\
This led to unemployment, poverty, homelessness and social displacement from rural areas in European countries (The New Dawn 2012).\
For European governments it made sense to “export” this “surplus population” to overseas territories where they could farm the lands and secure a foothold for their motherlands.\
In this way, European countries established settler colonies in Africa.\
From 1873 to 1879 Europe and North America experienced an economic depression.\
This depression lasted even longer in Britain.\
During this period prices for commodities fell drastically and European countries were attracted to Africa’s abundant resources and the potential of cheap African labour to boost their flagging economies.\
Africa was also seen as a profitable new market for European products.\
The discovery of diamonds in South Africa in 1867 added fuel to the fire (The New Dawn 2012).\
As a result, competition between European countries to obtain footholds in Africa heated up.\
Consequently, the German Chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, called a conference in Berlin in 1884 to settle disputes over territories in Africa.\
All the European states were invited to participate in the conference.\
The United States, who had an interest in Liberia, was also invited to the conference (Black Past 2009).\
No Africans were invited to the conference or had a say in the proceedings.\
The result of this conference was that parts of Africa were parcelled out to European countries that had the strongest claim to the territories in question.\
The borders of Africa were drawn according to European spheres of influence.

![Figure 1.1: The borders of Africa after the Berlin Conference in 1885](../../../../other/img/figure1-1-DVA1501-Unit01.png)

Figure 1.1 is a map that shows how the borders in Africa were drawn after the Berlin Conference in 1885.\
Note that not all of Africa was under the control of Europe at this point (Oliver 2005:118–129).

The Berlin Conference started a period that lasted until 1914, known today as the Scramble for Africa.\
Besides economic reasons, there were political and religious reasons for this scramble (The New Dawn 2012).\
European countries vied with each other for political pre-eminence.\
One way in which this pre-eminence could be gained was through the expansion of their “empires” by the acquisition of territories.\

They had already colonized most of Asia; only Africa was left.\
European countries sought to consolidate their interests in Africa through military power.\
Africans could not protect themselves against the advanced weapons of the Europeans.\
At the same time, Europeans felt it was their moral duty to bring Christianity to Africa.\
That is why colonization went hand in hand with the establishment of missions in Africa.\
Missionaries brought Western-style education to Africa and dispersed Western beliefs.\
By 1914, almost 90% of Africa was under European control.

![Figure 1.2: The colonisation of Africa – 1914](../../../../other/img/figure1-2-DVA1501-Unit01.png)

Figure 1.2 is a map of Africa in 1914 and gives an indication of colonial influence.\
The smaller map in the inserted box indicates the influence of Europe before the Berlin Conference.\
As can be seen from the main map, Britain and France had the most colonies and influence in Africa.

The First World War broke out in July 1914. After the war, in 1918, a global movement started that advocated the right of people to rule themselves.\
People in colonies started to revolt against their colonial oppressors and demanded independence.\
This movement gained momentum after the Second World War, which lasted from September 1939 to September 1945.\
The European countries that had colonies were suffering the after-effects of the Second World War.\
They did not have the will or the wealth to suppress revolutions in their colonies.\
In addition, the US was strongly against colonization and was now the world’s superpower.\
The European countries that had colonies began to prepare their colonies for the transition to independence.\
Slowly but surely, the colonies of Asia and Africa started to gain their independence and freedom.\
This process was known as decolonization (Boahen 1985).

![Figure 1.3: The decolonisation of Africa](../../../../other/img/figure1-3-DVA1501-Unit01.png)

Figure 1.3 indicates the dates by which African countries became independent.

Colonialism had several negative impacts on Africa.\
It was never the intention of the European “mother countries” to develop Africa.\
All they were interested in was extracting raw materials, exporting them to Europe and then selling the finished goods in Africa.\
Many Africans lost their land or where unable to live off their land as a result of colonial policies.\
As a result, they started to work on European farms or moved to urban areas where they were used as cheap labour in European industries such as mining.\
Working conditions were bad and often workers were paid with food (Boahen 1985).

The most fertile lands were taken by settlers for farming cash crops such as rubber, cocoa, coffee, tea, cotton and tobacco.\
Since the focus was on producing cash crops for exportation and not food crops, many Africans experienced famine.

**Additionally**, Africans were **not allowed to grow cash crops to benefit themselves**.\
They were also **not allowed to trade amongst themselves** (Boahen 1985).

<u>Additional negative impacts were</u>:

- resource depletion
- unfair taxation
- a lack of industrialization
- and the breaking up of traditional African society and values.

<u>Colonization did have a few positive impacts:</u>.

- It brought advanced medicine to Africa
- and established infrastructure, and missionaries introduced literacy (Boahen 1985).

# Classifying Countries

Politicians, the media and academics all use certain words to distinguish between rich and poor countries.\
<u>such as</u>:

- “First World” and “Third World” countries
- “developing” and “developed” countries
- “North” and “South”, and “the West” and “the East”

This section will look at the meaning of these words.

## The First World and the Third World

When the former colonized countries became independent, there were two distinct political, economic and military blocs in the world.\
The one group consisted of the capitalist countries headed by the US and included the former colonizers and other capitalist countries in Europe.\
They were known as the First World. Then there was the socialist bloc, headed by the Soviet Union and its allies, such as Romania, Poland, Hungary, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Albania and Bulgaria.\
These countries were known as the Second World.\

These two groups of countries were locked in a state of hostility called the Cold War, which lasted from the end of the Second World War until 1989.\
During the Cold War the two groups of counties vied for the attention of the former colonized countries to garner their support for their political and economic ideologies and to get them “on their side”.\

However, when the former colonized countries of Latin America, Asia and Africa came together to discuss their problems and unique position in the world at Bandung in 1955, Belgrade in 1961 and Geneva (Group of 77) in 1964, it was clear that they did not want anything to do with either the First World or the Second World.\

They took up a third stance, or a third position, in international politics because they wanted to find their own place in the world system where they belonged to neither the First (capitalist) World nor to the Second (socialist) World.

They formed the Non-aligned Movement (NAM).\
The first person who called these countries the Third World was the French demographer, Alfred Sauvy.

He used the term tiers état (third estate) to refer to the stratification of French society before the French Revolution of 1789.

There were three strata in French society at the time:

- the French nobility at the top,
- the church and clergy in the middle
- and the poor masses and people deprived of privileges, including merchants, civil servants, artisans, peasants and salaried workers, at the bottom.

People from the bottom stratum, who were politically segregated at the time, embarked on the French Revolution to overcome their exclusion.\
Sauvy drew a comparison between this bottom stratum in French society and the newly independent countries.\
He argued that the newly independent countries had similar characteristics – they had been colonized and had, as a result, been deprived of privileges and oppressed for long periods.

They also had strong anticolonial feelings.\
Sauvy referred to them as the Third World in 1952 and the popular media quickly picked up this term to refer to this new group of countries.

![Figure 1.4: A map of First, Second and Third World countries](../../../../other/img/figure1-4-DVA1501-Unit01.png)

<u>Figure 1.4 is a map of First, Second and Third World countries</u>.

Even though the newly independent countries saw themselves as non-aligned, in reality, it was not that easy.\
It became very clear to the newly independent countries that they needed foreign assistance to industrialize and develop.\
They needed overseas markets for their primary products and they needed additional development assistance.\
As a result, the capitalist bloc, led by the US, and the communist bloc, led by the USSR, competed to obtain spheres of influence in the newly independent counties by offering them markets and development assistance (Kingsbury et al 2004:1).

In the end, both blocs established immense spheres of influence in developing countries.

![Figure 1.5: Map of capitalist and communist countries during the Cold War](../../../../other/img/figure1-5-DVA1501-Unit01.png)

Figure 1.5 shows the influence of communism and capitalism during the Cold War.\
The red dots indicate socialist movements that tried to overthrow capitalist regimes.\
The blue dots indicate capitalist guerrilla movements that sought to overthrow communist or socialist states.\
The stars show areas where wars and conflicts erupted during the Cold War.\
“Warsaw Pact” refers to the communist bloc; “NATO” refers to the US and its allies.

After 1989, the former Soviet bloc crumbled and the Second World disappeared.\
Nevertheless, the media sometimes still refer to rich countries as the First World and the former colonized countries as the Third World.\
Is it then correct to still refer to the First World and the Third World?

<u>Toye (1993:8–9) notes as follows in this regard</u>:

> If the Second World of state socialism has indeed vanished into an historical lim-
> bo, what meaning or purpose can now be attributed to a Third World, defined
> in contrast to it? None, certainly, if the Third World had been nothing more than
> the creation of the Cold War politics, the group of neutrals who wished a plague
> on the house of both capitalism and socialism. But … the Third World concept
> was always more complex than that. The political cement, which held the Third
> World together, was never merely a passive antipathy to the two competing Cold
> War ideologies. It was the collective experience of colonization and reasonable
> fear of neo-colonialism.

So, according to Toye, the concept “Third World” is still valid.\
The argument about the validity of the concept of the Third World is also raised in a book edited by Allen and Thomas (1992) for students of the British Open University.\
This book contains a definition of the Third World by an Egyptian economist, Abdalla (cited in Allen & Thomas 1992:5– 6), who argues that the Third World consists of all
those nations that, during the process of formation of the existing world order, did not become rich and industrialized.\
A historical perspective is essential for understanding what the Third World is because, by definition, it is the periphery of the system produced by the expansion of world capital.

In the light of this definition, Allen and Thomas (1992:6) point out that the term “Third World” is still valid.

## The concepts “developed countries”, “developing countries”, “less developed countries”, “least developed countries” and “underdeveloped countries”

These concepts are probably the most common descriptions used by the media, the international development community and governments to distinguish between rich and poor countries.\
Developed countries are normally described as industrialized countries that have mature and sophisticated economies, advanced technological infrastructure, diverse industrial and service sectors and good-quality healthcare and education systems.\
They are also usually seen as democratic (Developing Economics 2020).

Some international organizations use membership of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) as the main indicator of a country’s development status (Gbadamosi 2021).

The OECD was established in 1961 with the purpose of promoting world trade and economic growth.\
There were 20 original members, most of which were European countries, but also included the USA, Canada and Turkey (WorldAtlas 2021).

The OECD is also called the “rich countries club” since its member countries have an average income of $40 115 per person per year (Developing Economics 2020).\
Today, 36 countries belong to the OECD (WorldAtlas 2021).\
All countries that are not part of the OECD are seen as developing countries (Developing Economics 2020).

<u>The World Bank (2021b) classifies the world into four economic groups as follows</u>:

- **Low-income countries**. These are countries whose GNI per capita is below $1 035 (refer to section 1.5.1 for an explanation of GNI per capita).
- **Lower-middle-income countries**. These are countries whose GNI per capita is between $1 035 and $4 045.
- **Upper-middle-income countries**. These are countries whose GNI per capita is between $4 045 and $12 535.
- **High-income countries**. These are countries whose GNI per capita exceeds $12 536.

The World Bank refers to

- low- and middle-income countries as developing economies
- and upper-middle-income to high-income countries as developed countries (Gbadamosi 2021).

![Figure 1.6: The World Bank’s classification of countries according to income](../../../../other/img/figure1-6-DVA1501-Unit01.png)

Figure 1.6 shows the World Bank’s classification of countries according to their income in 2021.

The UNDP uses the Human Development Index as an indicator of whether a country is developed or developing. Section 1.5.2 discusses the HDI in depth.\
The HDI’s classification system allocates weights to certain human and economic development indicators in a country.\
Countries that are in the top quartile of the HDI distribution are seen as developed countries; the rest are seen as developing countries.\
Countries in the bottom quartile are seen as the least developed countries (LDCs).\
Sometimes, they are also called less developed or underdeveloped countries (Gbadamosi 2021).

![Figure 1.7: Human Development Index country map – 2020](../../../../other/img/figure1-7-DVA1501-Unit01.png)

Figure 1.7 shows the HDI map for 2020. Countries that are red are the LDCs.\
Most LDCs are from Africa. Countries that are dark green are the most developed countries.

The International Monetary Fund also mainly uses economic indicators to
distinguish between developed and developing countries, especially the following
three indicators: per capita income level, export diversification and the degree to
which a country is integrated into the global financial system. Based on these
indicators, the IMF distinguishes between “advanced”, “emerging” and
“developing” economies. Consequently, the LDCs are called “developing economy
countries” by the IMF (World Population Review 2021).
Those in favour of using these terms argue that the word “developing” is neutral
and puts most countries of the world in the same boat. Those against using these
terms argue that they are by no means neutral. They believe that the word
“developing” implies that there is an ideal state or condition of “being developed”
and that all countries of the world are making their way towards this condition –
some faster than others. It sketches a particular view of the world and an
expectation that there is a state of being or condition that is desirable, worth
striving for and uniform (or unvarying) and that it is inevitable that all countries
will eventually reach that condition or state of being. However, note that these
concepts can be culturally and subjectively determined. For instance, there are
many communities in the world that live traditionally like their ancestors did before
them. They live in harmony with nature and take only what they need from their
environment. They do not feel the need to embrace modern development. They
also do not see themselves as “less developed”. One must therefore guard against
stereotyping and judging communities based on First World standards of what is
seen as developed.

## North and South countries

An alternative way of referring to countries that has recently gained wide
acceptance is the use of the terms “North” and “South”. When we use these terms,
we reduce the idea of three worlds to two worlds. The capitalist First World
countries of the West and the old Second World countries are grouped in one
category, namely, the North. The Third World countries are mainly grouped
together in another category, the South. Most of the OECD countries, except
Australia and New Zealand, are in the northern hemisphere. That is why the
developed countries are often called “the North”. Figure 1.8 indicates developed
countries in red and developing countries in green. As you can see, most of the
developed countries are north of the equator while most countries in the South are
developing countries.

![Figure 1.8: The North–South divide](../../../../other/img/figure1-8-DVA1501-Unit01.png)

This North–South division is very general and imprecise since Australia and New
Zealand, which are developed countries, are south of the equator. Also, many
countries in the North are developing countries. Countries like Afghanistan, Nepal
and Bhutan are in the northern hemisphere but they are among the LDCs.

# Development Statistics and Indicators

## Economic Indicators

There are various scientific ways of comparing the levels of development of
different countries in order to distinguish between more developed and less
developed countries. The earliest indicators that were used were economic
indicators. One such indicator is the gross domestic product of a country, that is,
the total value (in money) of its economic output (i.e., all the things its people grow,
make and sell). GDP is easy to identify and measure (Todaro 1994:680). It is a
comprehensive measure, covering the production of consumer goods and services,
government services and investment goods. However, it does not count a country’s
income from foreign investments and other important economic criteria.
Nevertheless, through this single measure, it can be determined whether a country’s
economy is growing or slacking. GDP is usually used as an indicator in the form of
GDP per capita, which refers to GDP divided by total mid-year population (World
Bank 2009), in other words, the total income of the country divided by the number
of the population.

As an indicator of development, GDP per capita has its shortcomings. For instance,
it does not

- indicate whether a country is dependent on one industry (skills, location, fluctuations)
- include the income from the informal economy and unpaid work (e.g., subsistence farming, bartering)
- tell us about the rural economy of a country
- include remittances from migrant workers (people working outside the borders of their own countries)
- record the negative costs of economic growth, like pollution and environmental damage
- tell us how wealth is distributed in a country or who spends it and what it is spent on

Gross national product is another economic indicator. GNP is basically the same as
GDP, but it includes a country’s income from foreign investments, in other words,
how much companies in the country earn from their business in other countries.
GNP per capita is GNP divided by the total mid-year population (World Bank
2009).

The strengths of GNP per capita are that

- it is easily calculated (compared to social indicators)
- it takes income generated abroad by industry into account and therefore it is usually seen as a more accurate measure of economic development than GDP
- it also highlights rising wealth or contraction within a country

GNP per capita has many of the same weaknesses as GDP per capita. Its weaknesses are as follows:

- It still does not tell us about how income is distributed in a country.
- It tells us nothing about the quality of life experienced by the majority of the population of a country. As mentioned above, rising levels of GDP or GNP indicate increasing levels of wealth within a country, but that does not necessarily tell us if improved social conditions are experienced, for instance, better education and healthcare.
- It does not reflect output and income from unreported cash transactions (cash-in-hand work), such as activities in the informal sector, babysitting or helping a friend out with trade-related jobs. It also does not tell us how much money is made from illegal activities, such as drug sales and the selling of counterfeit goods.
- What is actually produced in developing countries does not always have a monetary value. For instance, subsistence farming still constitutes a significant proportion of the productive activities in poor countries, but it is not counted
- It reflects gender bias. It does not reflect the unpaid work done by women, such as domestic work and childcare. (Daniel Winsbury Sociology 2014)

In recent years, gross national income has become the preferred economic
indicator. GNI includes aid flows or remittances of salaries earned outside a
country (Dornan & Regan 2016:19). GNI per capita has been adopted by the
UNDP as an indicator for the Human Development Index.

The World Bank’s classification system is an elaborate one and much more
complex than a simple contrast between rich and poor. Nonetheless, it generalises
about conditions within countries and does not allow for division within countries.
Moreover, it implies that you have to use a classification system based almost
exclusively on economic criteria and indicators to measure development. An
example of how using only economic indicators can lead to a misleading picture of
a country is that of Equatorial Guinea. According to the World Bank, Equatorial
Guinea is an upper-middle-income country since its GNI per capita was $6 460 in 2019. Nevertheless, its citizens only live to 58,4 years and they have low levels of

schooling (Developing Economics 2020). Another good example is South Africa.
South Africa is classified as an upper-middle-income country according to its GNI
per capita (World Bank 2018b) but in a World Bank report from 2018, it is stated
that South Africa is the most unequal country in the world (World Bank 2018a).
As a result, the international development community has looked for other ways to
indicate the development of a country.

## The Human Development Index

In recognition of the limitations of economic indicators of development and the
fact that a “person’s access to income … is not the sum total of human endeavour”,
the UNDP decided to devise a more sophisticated approach. The result was the so-
called Human Development Index. The HDI was developed by Amartya Sen and
Mahbud ul Had in 1990 and combined three dimensions, namely, a long and
healthy life, knowledge and a decent standard of living.

1. **Long and healthy life** - The indicator that is used to measure a long and healthy life is life expectancy. Life expectancy is the number of years a new-born infant would live if prevailing patterns of mortality at the time of its birth were to stay the same throughout its life (World Bank 2009). The life expectancy of a country is converted into a life expectancy index. South Africa’s life expectancy at birth index is 64.1.
2. **Knowledge** - There are two indicators for knowledge, namely, mean years of schooling and expected years of schooling.

- - a. Mean years of schooling (MYS) replaced the adult literacy rate that was used before 2010. MYS indicates “the average number of completed years of education of a country’s population, excluding years spent repeating individual grades” (UNESCO Institute for Statistics 2013:3). MYS estimates apply to people aged 25 years and older. This indicator covers the following levels of educational attainment:
- - - No schooling
- - - Some primary education
- - - Completed primary education
- - - Completed lower secondary education
- - - Completed upper secondary education
- - - Completed post-secondary non-tertiary education
- - - Completed tertiary education (UNESCO Institute for Statistics 2013:2–3)

- - b. Expected years of schooling (EYS) replaced the “combined gross enrolment ratios in primary, secondary and tertiary education” that were used before 2010 (UNESCO Institute for Statistics 2013:2). Rigotti and Sawyer (2013:1), citing UNESCO (2009), describe EYS as “a measure of the number of years of schooling a child at the start of his or her education is expected to receive, if current rates of enrolment are maintained throughout the child’s life.” South Africa’s MYS is 13.8 and its EYS is 10.2 (UNDP 2020:344).

3. Decent standard of living. Before 2010, a country’s GDP per capita was used to indicate a decent standard of living; this was replaced with GNI per capita. South Africa’s GNI per capita is 12,129 (UNDP 2020:344).

A combined score of the indexes of these three dimensions is calculated to
produce a figure between 0 and 1, calculated to three decimal places. The nearer a
country is to the upper figure, the higher its assumed level of human development.
The UNDP produces an annual report called the Human development report that
indicates the HDI for that year (UNDP 2020)

The HDI is divided into four groups of countries according to their scores, namely:

1.  very high human development – 0,898
2.  high human development – 0,753
3.  medium human development – 0,631
4.  low human development – 0,513

The countries are then ranked from first to last in the world according to their
scores. In 2020, Norway, with a score of 0,957, ranked first and Niger, with a score
of 0,394, ranked last (189th position) (UNDP 2020:345). Note that Niger’s MYS
was 6,5 and its EYS was 2,1. Its low literacy rate landed it at the bottom of the
rankings. When we look at Equatorial Guinea again, we see that it ranked 145th in
2020 because of its poor health and education services. It is therefore clear that the
HDI gives a more accurate picture of human development than income alone.
Nevertheless, note that South Africa ranked 114th with a score of 0,709 in 2020
and therefore fell in the category of high human development. This score obscures
the fact that South Africa is the most unequal country in the world (Developing
Economics 2020; UNDP 2020:343–345). So, the HDI might work better to give us
a global picture of development, but it is by no means completely accurate. The
HDI is restricted by a lack of complete, accurate, comparable, updated data and
does not reflect environmental degradation.

## Under-five Morality Rate (U5MR)

The death rate of children younger than five years, also known as the under-five
mortality rate, is based on death and birth data. It indicates the probability of a
newborn dying before its fifth birthday. One of the major limitations of the U5MR
as a development indicator is a lack of reliable and accurate death and birth data to
calculate it, especially in less developed countries. The rate is expressed as deaths
per 1 000 live births. The U5MR for poor countries was about 99 deaths per 1 000
births for the period 2010 to 2015, compared to 7 deaths per 1 000 births for
richer nations in the same period (United Nations 2013). Sub-Saharan Africa had
the highest U5MR rate in 2015.

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which replaced the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs), set a global target for the U5MR at 25 or fewer
deaths per 1 000 live births by 2030.

A high U5MR is usually linked to factors such as:

- poor access to safe water and sanitation
- undernutrition
- poverty
- a lack of available, accessible and good-quality primary healthcare services
- poor educational attainment of parents (especially mothers)

For these reasons, the U5MR is a sensitive indicator of a country’s health and
nutritional status, primary healthcare services and social and educational progress.
In addition, it is possible to disaggregate (break down statistically) the U5MR for
different subgroups, for example, gender, race, ethnicity or region to see which
subsections are in the greatest need of assistance to improve the survival potential
of children.

As shown, development indicators have both strengths and limitations. The use of
each indicator depends on why it is used, who uses it, how it is used and probably
when it is used. The fact that indicators have shortcomings does not mean that
they have no value. They do, however, need to be used with circumspection.

# Conclusion

It is clear from the discussion that development is not just about economic
development but is also about human development. The indicators that we use to
measure development in a country only give us a partial view of the well-being of
the people in that county. It is clear that there is still a lot of room for improving
development indicators. We also looked at the way in which countries are classified.
In future you will understand what is meant by “least developed countries” when
you come across this term in the news.

We also looked at terms that are used to refer to countries. Some of these terms are
more useful than others. There is no wrong or right way to refer to countries. The
term that you decide to use will be based on personal preference. When you read
about poorer countries in the media, you will now understand what is meant by
terms such as “First World country”, “the North”, “the South” and “the Third
World”.

Lastly, you have gained an understanding that developing countries have long
histories of exploitation. Developing countries’ infrastructure, language and
institutions were all installed as a result of the experience of colonialism.
