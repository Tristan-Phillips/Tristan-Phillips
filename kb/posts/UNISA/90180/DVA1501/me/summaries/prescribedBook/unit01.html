<p><u>Poorer countries</u> are often referred to as the following by
governments or international organizations:</p>

<li>North / South</li>
<li>Third World / First World</li>

<p>
In order to understand the position of poorer countries in the world, we
must acknowledge that they have long histories of exploitation through
colonialism.
</p>
</details>
<p>Also look at how the following international institutions refer to
groups of countries <u>based on their wealth and/or human
development</u>:</p>
<ul>
<li>World Bank</li>
<li>International Monetary Fund (IMF)</li>
<li>United Nations (UN) organizations</li>
<li>The media</li>
</ul>
<p><u>They distinguish between</u>:</p>
<ul>
<li>the most developed countries</li>
<li>developed countries</li>
<li>less developed countries</li>
<li>developing countries</li>
<li>least developed countries</li>
</ul>
<p>The World Bank and the IMF use economic indicators such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>GDP per capita</li>
<li>GNP per capita</li>
<li>GNI per capita.</li>
</ul>
<p>The UN uses both the following to measure development in a
country:</p>
<ul>
<li>economic indicators</li>
<li>and human development indicators</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="defining-development">Defining Development</h1>
<p>Development means different things to different people, especially
professionals.<br />
<u>Such as</u>:</p>
<ul>
<li>For an <strong>economist</strong>, development means a high economic
growth rate in a country.</li>
<li>For a <strong>rural extension officer</strong>, development means an
increase in a small farmer’s agricultural productivity.</li>
<li>For a <strong>community development agent</strong>, development
means fostering resilient communities and seeing that their basic needs
are met.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Development was at first seen mainly as economic development but as
it became apparent that poverty had not lessened with economic
development, new theories emerged that were more people centred</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>According to Oxford learner’s dictionaries, the term “development”
means “the steady growth of something so that it becomes more advanced
[and] stronger”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><u>The internationally accepted definition of development is</u>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“a multidimensional undertaking to achieve a higher quality of life
for all people”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) (2021a)</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Development studies as an area of study therefore focuses on human
development.<br />
<u>In the Human development report (UNDP 2021b), human development is
defined as:</u></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“the process of enlarging people’s freedoms and opportunities and
improving their well-being. Human development is about the real freedom
ordinary people have to decide who to be, what to do, and how to
live”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mahbub ul Haq (Internationally accepted definition of human
development)</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Development studies is a bit more selective in its focus on
human development</strong>.<br />

<p>
The reality is that out of the world population of 7,9 billion people,
689 million people live in extreme or absolute poverty on less than
$1,90 a day.
</p>
<p>
The number of extremely poor people stabilized in 2018 but the Covid-19
pandemic pushed an additional 150 million people into extreme poverty by
2021 (World Bank 2021b).
</p>
<p>
This means that almost 9,2% of the world’s population live in a state of
severe deprivation in that they cannot fulfil their basic needs for
food, water, shelter and clothing (World Bank 2021b).
</p>
</details>
<p><u>Development studies is:</u><br />
Mainly focused on understanding the <strong>plight of the absolute poor
in rural and urban areas of the developing world and the factors that
impede their development</strong>.</p>

</summary>
<p>
Please note, that a staggering 433 million or 63% of the global absolute
poor live in sub-Saharan Africa.
</p>
<p>
It is also expected that this number will rise owing to the economic
backlash of the Covid-19 pandemic (World Bank 2021b).

<p>The following Box 1.1 contains an extract from Kingsbury et al
(2004:2) that gives insight into the meaning of development</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The idea of ‘development’ of the world’s poorer countries is both
highly contentious and central to international relations. Put simply,
the study of development is concerned with how ‘developing countries’
can improve their living standards and eliminate absolute po- verty.
Development has a range of meanings, which while in most cases
complementary or at least overlapping, may be quite distinct in the
priority they give, for example, to equity, to political development and
democratization, to gender, or to environmental issues and thus in their
implications for action. Even the terminology of development has changed
and is continuing to change. The whole approach to development, assumed
for years to occur through a process of industrialization, is also now
in question. The emphasis on develop- ment has increasingly moved away
from what the ‘experts’ say ‘development’ is, to what people seeking
‘development’ want it to be. . The shift in the categorization of what
constitutes development began to not only diversify ‘ownership’ of the
meaning of development, but also reflected the diversity of responses to
the development process. Development is, perhaps the world’s most
critical problem, incor- porating most of the world’s pressing issues.
At the same time, the subject of development has retreated to
increasingly simple formulae in the minds of many of the people and gov-
ernments able to address it meaningfully. For the purpose of the book,
and as already indicated, development means the process by which the
people and states outside the indus- trialized world attempt to improve
their conditions of life, through material and social means. In this
development implies change, affecting most, if not all, areas of life.
The idea of development is a multi-dimensional and, by definition,
interdisciplinary field in which economic, political, technological,
social and cultural factors interact. Source: Kingsbury et al

<h1 id="the-colonial-history-of-africa">The Colonial History Of
Africa</h1>
<p><u>Up until the 16th century</u><br />
trade occurred mainly between the countries of:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Mediterranean,</li>
<li>China and India.</li>
</ul>
<p>Following the invention of the compass, Europeans could reach the
Americas.<br />
European countries such as England, France, Spain, Portugal and The
Netherlands became very wealthy<br />

</ul>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(Prabhakar 2003:310–312; Linden 2003:52)</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The European countries began to compete with each other in order to
safeguard their trade interests in their overseas markets.<br />
In the process they found it beneficial to exercise dominance and
control over their trade areas.<br />
This is called imperialism.</p>
<p>During the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries this informal economic and
political domination became more aggressive,<br />
to the point that military force was used to establish complete military
and political control and dominion over these areas.<br />
The European countries also settled these countries with their own
people.<br />
They claimed absolute sovereignty over these regions and established
government systems, legal and social structures, and economic systems in
these territories.<br />
This is called colonization.</p>
<p>The colonies became an extension of the European countries’ own
territories.<br />
Latin America and Asia were the first continents to become
colonized.<br />
Most of Latin America belonged to Spain and Portugal by the beginning of
the 1800s.<br />
Territories in Asia were first under the influence of Spain and Portugal
but were taken over by The Netherlands, England and France in the 17th
century.<br />
Britain was the most successful colonizer in Asia and most of Asia
belonged to Britain at the end of the Second World War.</p>
<p>The colonization of territories brought great wealth to the
colonizers.<br />
The chief objective of the colonizers was to exploit the colonies’
natural resources and labour to fuel their home-based industries and
development.<br />
Consequently, the infrastructure and the systems that were put in place
in the colonies were there for the sole purpose of extracting resources
and raw materials.<br />
These raw materials included minerals and precious stones, food and cash
crops, wood and many other products. (Linden 2003:52).</p>
<p>The period of colonization lasted until after the Second World War in
1945 (Prabhakar 2003:313– 314).<br />
Spain and Portugal lost control over their Latin American territories by
1830.<br />
Africa was the last continent to be colonized.<br />
The only European countries that had influence in Africa before 1860
were Britain, France and Portugal.<br />
Before 1860, they exercised their influence mainly over the coastal
areas of Africa.<br />
The reason why Africa was colonized last was that the Europeans found
the conditions in Africa dangerous.<br />
Many Europeans, for instance, died from diseases such as malaria (Oliver
2005:118– 129).<br />
In 1820 it was discovered that quinine can treat malaria very
effectively.<br />
As a result, Europeans started to venture deeper into Africa.<br />
Expeditions led by explorers such as David Livingstone and Henry Morton
Stanley in the mid-1800s provided useful information about the interior
of Africa.<br />
At the same time, one of the consequences of industrialization in Europe
was the negative effect of industrial capitalism on the European
populace.<br />
Not all labour could be absorbed by European industries.<br />
This led to unemployment, poverty, homelessness and social displacement
from rural areas in European countries (The New Dawn 2012).<br />
For European governments it made sense to “export” this “surplus
population” to overseas territories where they could farm the lands and
secure a foothold for their motherlands.<br />
In this way, European countries established settler colonies in
Africa.<br />
From 1873 to 1879 Europe and North America experienced an economic
depression.<br />
This depression lasted even longer in Britain.<br />
During this period prices for commodities fell drastically and European
countries were attracted to Africa’s abundant resources and the
potential of cheap African labour to boost their flagging
economies.<br />
Africa was also seen as a profitable new market for European
products.<br />
The discovery of diamonds in South Africa in 1867 added fuel to the fire
(The New Dawn 2012).<br />
As a result, competition between European countries to obtain footholds
in Africa heated up.<br />
Consequently, the German Chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, called a
conference in Berlin in 1884 to settle disputes over territories in
Africa.<br />
All the European states were invited to participate in the
conference.<br />
The United States, who had an interest in Liberia, was also invited to
the conference (Black Past 2009).<br />
No Africans were invited to the conference or had a say in the
proceedings.<br />
The result of this conference was that parts of Africa were parcelled
out to European countries that had the strongest claim to the
territories in question.<br />
The borders of Africa were drawn according to European spheres of
influence.</p>

</figure>
<p>Figure 1.1 is a map that shows how the borders in Africa were drawn
after the Berlin Conference in 1885.<br />
Note that not all of Africa was under the control of Europe at this
point (Oliver 2005:118–129).</p>
<p>The Berlin Conference started a period that lasted until 1914, known
today as the Scramble for Africa.<br />
Besides economic reasons, there were political and religious reasons for
this scramble (The New Dawn 2012).<br />
European countries vied with each other for political
pre-eminence.<br />
One way in which this pre-eminence could be gained was through the
expansion of their “empires” by the acquisition of territories.<br />
</p>
<p>They had already colonized most of Asia; only Africa was left.<br />
European countries sought to consolidate their interests in Africa
through military power.<br />
Africans could not protect themselves against the advanced weapons of
the Europeans.<br />
At the same time, Europeans felt it was their moral duty to bring
Christianity to Africa.<br />
That is why colonization went hand in hand with the establishment of
missions in Africa.<br />
Missionaries brought Western-style education to Africa and dispersed
Western beliefs.<br />
By 1914, almost 90% of Africa was under European control.</p>

<p>Figure 1.2 is a map of Africa in 1914 and gives an indication of
colonial influence.<br />
The smaller map in the inserted box indicates the influence of Europe
before the Berlin Conference.<br />
As can be seen from the main map, Britain and France had the most
colonies and influence in Africa.</p>
<p>The First World War broke out in July 1914. After the war, in 1918, a
global movement started that advocated the right of people to rule
themselves.<br />
People in colonies started to revolt against their colonial oppressors
and demanded independence.<br />
This movement gained momentum after the Second World War, which lasted
from September 1939 to September 1945.<br />
The European countries that had colonies were suffering the
after-effects of the Second World War.<br />
They did not have the will or the wealth to suppress revolutions in
their colonies.<br />
In addition, the US was strongly against colonization and was now the
world’s superpower.<br />
The European countries that had colonies began to prepare their colonies
for the transition to independence.<br />
Slowly but surely, the colonies of Asia and Africa started to gain their
independence and freedom.<br />
This process was known as decolonization (Boahen 1985).</p>

<p>Figure 1.3 indicates the dates by which African countries became

<p>Colonialism had several negative impacts on Africa.<br />
It was never the intention of the European “mother countries” to develop
Africa.<br />
All they were interested in was extracting raw materials, exporting them
to Europe and then selling the finished goods in Africa.<br />
Many Africans lost their land or where unable to live off their land as
a result of colonial policies.<br />
As a result, they started to work on European farms or moved to urban
areas where they were used as cheap labour in European industries such
as mining.<br />
Working conditions were bad and often workers were paid with food
(Boahen 1985).</p>
<p>The most fertile lands were taken by settlers for farming cash crops
such as rubber, cocoa, coffee, tea, cotton and tobacco.<br />
Since the focus was on producing cash crops for exportation and not food
crops, many Africans experienced famine.</p>
<p><strong>Additionally</strong>, Africans were <strong>not allowed to
grow cash crops to benefit themselves</strong>.<br />
They were also <strong>not allowed to trade amongst themselves</strong>
(Boahen 1985).</p>
<p><u>Additional negative impacts were</u>:</p>
<ul>
<li>resource depletion</li>
<li>unfair taxation</li>
<li>a lack of industrialization</li>
<li>and the breaking up of traditional African society and values.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Colonization did have a few positive impacts:</u>.</p>
<ul>
<li>It brought advanced medicine to Africa</li>
<li>and established infrastructure, and missionaries introduced literacy
(Boahen 1985).</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="classifying-countries">Classifying Countries</h1>
<p>Politicians, the media and academics all use certain words to
distinguish between rich and poor countries.<br />
<u>such as</u>:</p>
<ul>
<li>“First World” and “Third World” countries</li>
<li>“developing” and “developed” countries</li>
<li>“North” and “South”, and “the West” and “the East”</li>
</ul>
<p>This section will look at the meaning of these words.</p>
<h2 id="the-first-world-and-the-third-world">The First World and the
Third World</h2>
<p>When the former colonized countries became independent, there were
two distinct political, economic and military blocs in the world.<br />
The one group consisted of the capitalist countries headed by the US and
included the former colonizers and other capitalist countries in
Europe.<br />
They were known as the First World. Then there was the socialist bloc,
headed by the Soviet Union and its allies, such as Romania, Poland,
Hungary, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Albania and Bulgaria.<br />
These countries were known as the Second World.<br />
</p>
<p>These two groups of countries were locked in a state of hostility
called the Cold War, which lasted from the end of the Second World War
until 1989.<br />
During the Cold War the two groups of counties vied for the attention of
the former colonized countries to garner their support for their
political and economic ideologies and to get them “on their side”.<br />
</p>
<p>However, when the former colonized countries of Latin America, Asia
and Africa came together to discuss their problems and unique position
in the world at Bandung in 1955, Belgrade in 1961 and Geneva (Group of
77) in 1964, it was clear that they did not want anything to do with
either the First World or the Second World.<br />
</p>
<p>They took up a third stance, or a third position, in international
politics because they wanted to find their own place in the world system
where they belonged to neither the First (capitalist) World nor to the
Second (socialist) World.</p>
<p>They formed the Non-aligned Movement (NAM).<br />
The first person who called these countries the Third World was the
French demographer, Alfred Sauvy.</p>
<p>He used the term tiers état (third estate) to refer to the
stratification of French society before the French Revolution of
1789.</p>
<p>There were three strata in French society at the time:</p>
<ul>
<li>the French nobility at the top,</li>
<li>the church and clergy in the middle</li>
<li>and the poor masses and people deprived of privileges, including
merchants, civil servants, artisans, peasants and salaried workers, at
the bottom.</li>
</ul>
<p>People from the bottom stratum, who were politically segregated at
the time, embarked on the French Revolution to overcome their
exclusion.<br />
Sauvy drew a comparison between this bottom stratum in French society
and the newly independent countries.<br />
He argued that the newly independent countries had similar
characteristics – they had been colonized and had, as a result, been
deprived of privileges and oppressed for long periods.</p>
<p>They also had strong anticolonial feelings.<br />
Sauvy referred to them as the Third World in 1952 and the popular media
quickly picked up this term to refer to this new group of countries.</p>

Third World countries</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><u>Figure 1.4 is a map of First, Second and Third World
countries</u>.</p>
<p>Even though the newly independent countries saw themselves as
non-aligned, in reality, it was not that easy.<br />
It became very clear to the newly independent countries that they needed
foreign assistance to industrialize and develop.<br />
They needed overseas markets for their primary products and they needed
additional development assistance.<br />
As a result, the capitalist bloc, led by the US, and the communist bloc,
led by the USSR, competed to obtain spheres of influence in the newly
independent counties by offering them markets and development assistance
(Kingsbury et al 2004:1).</p>
<p>In the end, both blocs established immense spheres of influence in
developing countries.</p>

The red dots indicate socialist movements that tried to overthrow

The stars show areas where wars and conflicts erupted during the Cold
War.<br />
“Warsaw Pact” refers to the communist bloc; “NATO” refers to the US and
its allies.</p>
<p>After 1989, the former Soviet bloc crumbled and the Second World
disappeared.<br />
Nevertheless, the media sometimes still refer to rich countries as the
First World and the former colonized countries as the Third World.<br />
Is it then correct to still refer to the First World and the Third
World?</p>
<p><u>Toye (1993:8–9) notes as follows in this regard</u>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the Second World of state socialism has indeed vanished into an
historical lim- bo, what meaning or purpose can now be attributed to a
Third World, defined in contrast to it? None, certainly, if the Third
World had been nothing more than the creation of the Cold War politics,
the group of neutrals who wished a plague on the house of both
capitalism and socialism. But … the Third World concept was always more
complex than that. The political cement, which held the Third World
together, was never merely a passive antipathy to the two competing Cold
War ideologies. It was the collective experience of colonization and
reasonable fear of neo-colonialism.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, according to Toye, the concept “Third World” is still
valid.<br />
The argument about the validity of the concept of the Third World is
also raised in a book edited by Allen and Thomas (1992) for students of
the British Open University.<br />
This book contains a definition of the Third World by an Egyptian
economist, Abdalla (cited in Allen &amp; Thomas 1992:5– 6), who argues
that the Third World consists of all those nations that, during the
process of formation of the existing world order, did not become rich
and industrialized.<br />
A historical perspective is essential for understanding what the Third
World is because, by definition, it is the periphery of the system
produced by the expansion of world capital.</p>
<p>In the light of this definition, Allen and Thomas (1992:6) point out
that the term “Third World” is still valid.</p>
<h2
id="the-concepts-developed-countries-developing-countries-less-developed-countries-least-developed-countries-and-underdeveloped-countries">The
concepts “developed countries”, “developing countries”, “less developed
countries”, “least developed countries” and “underdeveloped
countries”</h2>
<p>These concepts are probably the most common descriptions used by the
media, the international development community and governments to
distinguish between rich and poor countries.<br />
Developed countries are normally described as industrialized countries
that have mature and sophisticated economies, advanced technological
infrastructure, diverse industrial and service sectors and good-quality
healthcare and education systems.<br />
They are also usually seen as democratic (Developing Economics
2020).</p>
<p>Some international organizations use membership of the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) as the main indicator of
a country’s development status (Gbadamosi 2021).</p>
<p>The OECD was established in 1961 with the purpose of promoting world
trade and economic growth.<br />
There were 20 original members, most of which were European countries,
but also included the USA, Canada and Turkey (WorldAtlas 2021).</p>
<p>The OECD is also called the “rich countries club” since its member
countries have an average income of $40 115 per person per year
(Developing Economics 2020).<br />
Today, 36 countries belong to the OECD (WorldAtlas 2021).<br />
All countries that are not part of the OECD are seen as developing
countries (Developing Economics 2020).</p>
<p><u>The World Bank (2021b) classifies the world into four economic
groups as follows</u>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Low-income countries</strong>. These are countries whose GNI
per capita is below $1 035 (refer to section 1.5.1 for an explanation of
GNI per capita).</li>
<li><strong>Lower-middle-income countries</strong>. These are countries
whose GNI per capita is between $1 035 and $4 045.</li>
<li><strong>Upper-middle-income countries</strong>. These are countries
whose GNI per capita is between $4 045 and $12 535.</li>
<li><strong>High-income countries</strong>. These are countries whose
GNI per capita exceeds $12 536.</li>
</ul>
<p>The World Bank refers to</p>
<ul>
<li>low- and middle-income countries as developing economies</li>
<li>and upper-middle-income to high-income countries as developed
countries (Gbadamosi 2021).</li>
</ul>

<p>Figure 1.6 shows the World Bank’s classification of countries
according to their income in 2021.</p>
<p>The UNDP uses the Human Development Index as an indicator of whether
a country is developed or developing. Section 1.5.2 discusses the HDI in
depth.<br />
The HDI’s classification system allocates weights to certain human and
economic development indicators in a country.<br />
Countries that are in the top quartile of the HDI distribution are seen
as developed countries; the rest are seen as developing countries.<br />
Countries in the bottom quartile are seen as the least developed
countries (LDCs).<br />
Sometimes, they are also called less developed or underdeveloped
countries (Gbadamosi 2021).</p>

<p>Figure 1.7 shows the HDI map for 2020. Countries that are red are the
LDCs.<br />
Most LDCs are from Africa. Countries that are dark green are the most
developed countries.</p>
<p>The International Monetary Fund also mainly uses economic indicators
to <u>distinguish between developed and developing countries</u>,
especially the following three indicators:</p>
<ul>
<li>per capita income level</li>
<li>export diversification</li>
<li>the degree to which a country is integrated into the global
financial system</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on these indicators, the IMF distinguishes between:</p>
<ul>
<li>“advanced”economies</li>
<li>“emerging” economies</li>
<li>“developing” economies</li>
</ul>
<p>Consequently, the <strong>LDCs are called “developing economy
countries” by the IMF</strong> (World Population Review 2021).</p>
<p>Those in favour of using these terms argue that:</p>
<ul>
<li>the word “developing” is neutral and puts most countries of the
world in the same boat.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those against using these terms argue that:</p>
<ul>
<li>they are by no means neutral.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>They believe that the word “developing” implies that there is
an ideal state or condition of “being developed” and that all countries
of the world are making their way towards this condition – some faster
than others</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>It sketches a particular view of the world and an expectation
that there is a state of being or condition that is desirable, worth
striving for and uniform (or unvarying) and that it is inevitable that
all countries will eventually reach that condition or state of
being.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, note that these concepts can be culturally and subjectively
determined. For instance, there are many communities in the world that
live traditionally like their ancestors did before them. They live in
harmony with nature and take only what they need from their environment.
They do not feel the need to embrace modern development. They also do
not see themselves as <strong>“less developed”</strong>. <u>One must
therefore guard against stereotyping and judging communities based on
First World standards of what is seen as developed</u>.</p>

<h1 id="development-statistics-and-indicators">Development Statistics
and Indicators</h1>
<h2 id="economic-indicators">Economic Indicators</h2>
<p>There are various scientific ways of comparing the levels of
development of different countries in order to distinguish between more
developed and less developed countries.</p>
<p>The earliest indicators that were used were economic indicators.</p>
<ul>
<li>One such indicator is the gross domestic product of a country, that
is, the total value (in money) of its economic output (i.e., all the
things its people grow, make and sell). GDP is easy to identify and
measure (Todaro 1994:680).</li>
</ul>
<p>It is a comprehensive measure, covering the production of consumer
goods and services, government services and investment goods.</p>
<p>However, it does not count a country’s income from foreign
investments and other important economic criteria. Nevertheless, through
this single measure, it can be determined whether a country’s economy is
growing or slacking.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GDP is usually used as an indicator in the form of GDP per capita,
which refers to GDP divided by total mid-year population (World Bank
2009), in other words, <strong>the total income of the country divided
by the number of the population</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As an indicator of development, GDP per capita has its
shortcomings.<br />
<u>For instance, it does not</u>:</p>
<ul>
<li>indicate whether a country is dependent on one industry (skills,
location, fluctuations)</li>
<li>include the income from the informal economy and unpaid work (e.g.,
subsistence farming, bartering)</li>
<li>tell us about the rural economy of a country</li>
<li>include remittances from migrant workers (people working outside the
borders of their own countries)</li>
<li>record the negative costs of economic growth, like pollution and
environmental damage</li>
<li>tell us how wealth is distributed in a country or who spends it and
what it is spent on</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Gross national product is another economic indicator.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><u>GNP is basically the same as GDP</u>, but it includes a country’s
income from foreign investments, in other words, how much companies in
the country earn from their business in other countries.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GNP per capita is GNP divided by the total mid-year population (World
Bank 2009).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The strengths of GNP per capita are that:</p>
<ul>
<li>it is easily calculated (compared to social indicators)</li>
<li>it takes income generated abroad by industry into account and
therefore it is usually seen as a more accurate measure of economic
development than GDP</li>
<li>it also highlights rising wealth or contraction within a
country</li>
</ul>
<p>GNP per capita has many of the <strong>same weaknesses</strong> as
GDP per capita.<br />
<u>Its weaknesses are as follows</u>:</p>
<ul>
<li>It still does not tell us about how income is distributed in a
country.</li>
<li>It tells us nothing about the quality of life experienced by the
majority of the population of a country. As mentioned above, rising
levels of GDP or GNP indicate increasing levels of wealth within a
country, but that does not necessarily tell us if improved social
conditions are experienced, for instance, better education and
healthcare.</li>
<li>It does not reflect output and income from unreported cash
transactions (cash-in-hand work), such as activities in the informal
sector, babysitting or helping a friend out with trade-related jobs. It
also does not tell us how much money is made from illegal activities,
such as drug sales and the selling of counterfeit goods.</li>
<li>What is actually produced in developing countries does not always
have a monetary value. For instance, subsistence farming still
constitutes a significant proportion of the productive activities in
poor countries, but it is not counted</li>
<li>It reflects gender bias. It does not reflect the unpaid work done by
women, such as domestic work and childcare. (Daniel Winsbury Sociology
2014)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>In recent years, <strong>gross national income has become the
preferred economic indicator</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>GNI includes aid flows or remittances of salaries earned outside a
country (Dornan &amp; Regan 2016:19).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GNI per capita has been adopted by the UNDP as an indicator for the
Human Development Index.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The World Bank’s classification system is an elaborate one and much
more complex than a simple contrast between rich and poor.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it generalizes about conditions within countries and
does not allow for division within countries. Moreover, it implies that
you have to use a classification system based almost exclusively on
economic criteria and indicators to measure development.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>An example of how using only economic indicators can lead to a
misleading picture of a country is that of Equatorial Guinea. According
to the World Bank, Equatorial Guinea is an upper-middle-income country
since its GNI per capita was $6 460 in 2019. Nevertheless, its citizens
only live to 58,4 years and they have low levels of schooling
(Developing Economics 2020).</p></li>
<li><p>Another good example is South Africa. South Africa is classified
as an upper-middle-income country according to its GNI per capita (World
Bank 2018b) but in a World Bank report from 2018, it is stated that
South Africa is the most unequal country in the world (World Bank
2018a).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, the international development community has looked for
other ways to indicate the development of a country.</p>
<h2 id="the-human-development-index">The Human Development Index</h2>
<p>In recognition of the limitations of economic indicators of
development and the fact that a “person’s access to income … is not the
sum total of human endeavour”, the UNDP decided to devise a more
sophisticated approach.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The result was the so-called Human Development Index.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The HDI was <strong>developed by Amartya Sen and Mahbud ul Had in
1990</strong> and combined three dimensions, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>a long and healthy life</li>
<li>knowledge</li>
<li>a decent standard of living.</li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Long and healthy life</strong> - The indicator that is used
to measure a long and healthy life is life expectancy. Life expectancy
is the number of years a new-born infant would live if prevailing
patterns of mortality at the time of its birth were to stay the same
throughout its life (World Bank 2009). The life expectancy of a country
is converted into a life expectancy index. South Africa’s life
expectancy at birth index is 64.1.</li>
<li><strong>Knowledge</strong> - There are two indicators for knowledge,
namely, mean years of schooling and expected years of schooling.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><ul>
<li><ol type="a">
<li>Mean years of schooling (MYS) replaced the adult literacy rate that
was used before 2010. MYS indicates “the average number of completed
years of education of a country’s population, excluding years spent
repeating individual grades” (UNESCO Institute for Statistics 2013:3).
MYS estimates apply to people aged 25 years and older. This indicator
covers the following levels of educational attainment:</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li><ul>
<li><ul>
<li>No schooling</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><ul>
<li><ul>
<li>Some primary education</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><ul>
<li><ul>
<li>Completed primary education</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><ul>
<li><ul>
<li>Completed lower secondary education</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><ul>
<li><ul>
<li>Completed upper secondary education</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><ul>
<li><ul>
<li>Completed post-secondary non-tertiary education</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><ul>
<li><ul>
<li>Completed tertiary education (UNESCO Institute for Statistics
2013:2–3)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><ul>
<li><ol start="2" type="a">
<li>Expected years of schooling (EYS) replaced the “combined gross
enrolment ratios in primary, secondary and tertiary education” that were
used before 2010 (UNESCO Institute for Statistics 2013:2). Rigotti and
Sawyer (2013:1), citing UNESCO (2009), describe EYS as “a measure of the
number of years of schooling a child at the start of his or her
education is expected to receive, if current rates of enrolment are
maintained throughout the child’s life.” South Africa’s MYS is 13.8 and
its EYS is 10.2 (UNDP 2020:344).</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Decent standard of living. Before 2010, a country’s GDP per capita
was used to indicate a decent standard of living; this was replaced with
GNI per capita. South Africa’s GNI per capita is 12,129 (UNDP
2020:344).</li>
</ol>
<p>A combined score of the indexes of these three dimensions is
calculated to produce a figure <strong>between 0 and 1</strong>,
<strong>calculated to three decimal places</strong>.</p>
<p>The nearer a country is to the upper figure, the higher its assumed
level of human development.</p>
<p>The UNDP produces an annual report called the Human development
report that indicates the HDI for that year (UNDP 2020)</p>
<p><u>The HDI is divided into four groups of countries according to
their scores, namely</u>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>very high human development – 0,898</li>
<li>high human development – 0,753</li>
<li>medium human development – 0,631</li>
<li>low human development – 0,513</li>
</ol>
<p>The countries are then ranked from first to last in the world
according to their scores.</p>
<p>In 2020, Norway, with a score of 0,957, ranked first and Niger, with
a score of 0,394, ranked last (189th position) (UNDP 2020:345).</p>
<p>Note that Niger’s MYS was 6,5 and its EYS was 2,1. Its low literacy
rate landed it at the bottom of the rankings.</p>
<p>When we look at Equatorial Guinea again, we see that it ranked 145th
in 2020 because of its poor health and education services.</p>
<p>It is therefore clear that the <strong>HDI gives a more accurate
picture of human development than income alone</strong>.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, note that South Africa ranked 114th with a score of
0,709 in 2020 and therefore fell in the category of high human
development.</p>
<p>This score obscures the fact that South Africa is the most unequal
country in the world (Developing Economics 2020; UNDP 2020:343–345). So,
the H<strong>DI might work better to give us a global picture of
development, but it is by no means completely accurate</strong>.</p>
<p>The HDI is restricted by a lack of:</p>
<ul>
<li>complete</li>
<li>accurate</li>
<li>comparable</li>
<li>updated data</li>
</ul>
<p>and does not reflect environmental degradation.</p>
<h2 id="under-five-morality-rate-u5mr">Under-five Morality Rate
(U5MR)</h2>
<p>The death rate of children younger than five years, also known as the
under-five mortality rate, is based on death and birth data.</p>
<p>It indicates the probability of a newborn dying before its fifth
birthday.</p>
<p><strong>One of the major limitations of the U5MR as a development
indicator</strong> is a lack of reliable and accurate death and birth
data to calculate it, especially in less developed countries. The rate
is expressed as deaths per 1 000 live births.</p>
<p>The U5MR for poor countries was about 99 deaths per 1 000 births for
the period 2010 to 2015, compared to 7 deaths per 1 000 births for
richer nations in the same period (United Nations 2013).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sub-Saharan Africa had the highest U5MR rate in 2015.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which replaced the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), set a global target for the U5MR at
25 or fewer deaths per 1 000 live births by 2030.</p>
<p><u>A high U5MR is usually linked to factors such as</u>:</p>
<ul>
<li>poor access to safe water and sanitation</li>
<li>undernutrition</li>
<li>poverty</li>
<li>a lack of available, accessible and good-quality primary healthcare
services</li>
<li>poor educational attainment of parents (especially mothers)</li>
</ul>
<p>For these reasons, the U5MR is a sensitive indicator of a country’s
health and nutritional status, primary healthcare services and social
and educational progress.</p>
<p>In addition, it is possible to disaggregate (break down
statistically) the U5MR for different subgroups, for example, gender,
race, ethnicity or region to see which subsections are in the greatest
need of assistance to improve the survival potential of children.</p>
<p>As shown, development indicators have both strengths and limitations.
The use of each indicator depends on why it is used, who uses it, how it
is used and probably when it is used. <strong>The fact that indicators
have shortcomings does not mean that they have no value</strong>. They
do, however, need to be used with circumspection.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>It is clear from the discussion that development is not just about
economic development but is also about human development. The indicators
that we use to measure development in a country only give us a partial
view of the well-being of the people in that county. It is clear that
there is still a lot of room for improving development indicators. We
also looked at the way in which countries are classified.</p>
<p>In future you will understand what is meant by “least developed
countries” when you come across this term in the news.</p>
<p>We also looked at terms that are used to refer to countries. Some of
these terms are more useful than others.</p>
<p>There is no wrong or right way to refer to countries. The term that
you decide to use will be based on personal preference. When you read
about poorer countries in the media, you will now understand what is
meant by terms such as “First World country”, “the North”, “the South”
and “the Third World”.</p>
<p>Lastly, you have gained an understanding that developing countries
have long histories of exploitation. Developing countries’
infrastructure, language and institutions were all installed as a result
of the experience of colonialism.</p>
